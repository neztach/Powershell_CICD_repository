# Changelog

## [3.0.0] - 2020-07-17
### BREAKING CHANGE
- to significantly speed up import of new repository data to PS console (Refresh-Console) I have rewritten all synchronization scripts. As side effect, **you now have to call Repo_sync.ps1 in eponymous Scheduled Task on MGM server with -force switch**. If you are unsure how to do that, check [install instructions](https://github.com/ztrhgf/Powershell_CICD_repository/blob/master/1.%20HOW%20TO%20INSTALL.md#on-server-which-will-be-used-for-cloning-and-processing-cloud-repository-data-and-copying-result-to-dfs-ie-mgm-server) but basically you have to call `powershell.exe` with arguments: `-ExecutionPolicy ByPass -NoProfile -Command "&{"C:\Windows\Scripts\Repo_Sync\Repo_Sync.ps1" -force}"`
  - check help of Refresh-Console function for more information how to speed up synchronization even more (it can be almost 5x times faster than the old version!)
### Changed
- PSScriptAnalyzer 1.18.1 was replaced by 1.19.0
- pre-commit.ps1: processing AST through functions, bugfixes, warn about changed aliases, warn about variables in Variables module that dont start with underscore, warn if new variable would replace variable from repo_sync.ps1 or PS_env_set_up.ps1, trim lenghty messages
- commit-msg: check of commit name is now optional
- post-commit.ps1, post-merge.ps1: trim lenghty message
- customConfig: use new variable with underscore prefix
- Variables.psm1: new variables, rename of all variables to start with underscore (because of easy differentiation)
- modulesConfig.ps1: use new variable with underscore prefix
- repo_sync.ps1: better log output, possibility to process just changed files, marking generated modules as autogenerated, bugfixes
- Refresh-Console: by default on MGM server just changes will be processed, lot of new parameters to limit, what exactly should be synchronized 
- Send-Email: value of critical parameters are now by default variables defined in Variables module
- PS_env_set_up.ps1: new parameters to limit, what exactly should be synchronized to client from DFS repository
