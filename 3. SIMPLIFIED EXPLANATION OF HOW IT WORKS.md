# How code validation works
- after you commit your changes, pre-commit git hook automatically initiate checks defined in pre-commit.ps1
- only if all checks are passed, commit will be created and content distributed
  - checks can stop creation of commit completely, or warn you about possible problems and let you decide, whether to continue

## What is validated before commit is created
- that you are not trying to delete important repository files
- that Powershell files 
  - are encoded as UTF-8 or UTF-8 with BOM
  - have valid syntax
  - doesn't contain EN DASH, EM DASH instead of dash (it would lead to strange errors)
  - doesn't contain #FIXME comment, otherwise warn about it
  - from which modules are generated are in correct form
- warn about changed function parameters (in case, the functions is used elsewhere)
- warn about changed function aliases (in case, the alias is used elsewhere)
- warn about deleted function (in case, the function is used elsewhere)
- warn about changed variable value from module Variables (in case, the variable is used elsewhere)
- warn about deleted variable from module Variables (in case, the variable is used elsewhere)
- ...


# How distribution of content works
- after successful commit, content is automatically:
  - pushed to GIT repository
    - by post-commit GIT hook (post-commit.ps1)
  - pulled to local server, processed and (clients part) distributed to shared folder
    - by repo_sync.ps1 which is regularly run every 15 minutes by scheduled task
  - from shared folder the content is being downloaded by clients in your Active Directory
    - by PS_env_set_up.ps1 which is regularly run on client every 30 minutes by automatically created scheduled task (created via GPO PS_env_set_up)
