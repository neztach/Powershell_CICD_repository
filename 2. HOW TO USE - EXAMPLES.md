# HOW TO USE - EXAMPLES

---
### everything in *italics* refers to content of your locally cloned GIT CI/CD repository 

### every example bellow should be of course ended with commiting the change :)

---

- **Receive newest repo content + refresh running Powershell console**
  - just run function "ref" (stored in profile.ps1)
    - function will initialize update of DFS repo content, than download of this data to your computer and "refresh" running console from which ref was invoked, so you can immediately work with this new data without need to open new console (variables, functions, PATH, ..)
    - supports also refresh of remote computer
- **Distribute Powershell module to all clients**
  - place the module folder to *Modules*
- **Distribute Powershell module "Posh-SSH" to just computers "PC-1" and "PC-2"**
  - place the module "Posh-SSH" to *Modules*
  - edit *modulesConfig.ps1* as follows
  ```powershell
  $modulesConfig = @(
    [PSCustomObject]@{
        folderName   = "Posh-SSH" # name of module
        computerName = "PC-1", "PC-2" # name of computer/s (variable from module Variables could be used too)
    }
  ```
- **Create new Powershell function Get-CurrentLoad and distribute it to all clients**
  - in *scripts2module\Scripts* create file Get-CurrentLoad.ps1 with identically named function
  - after commit, this will lead to creation of Scripts module, that will contains all functions defined in ps1 scripts in *Scripts* folder and will be distributed on all clients
  - if you want to export function to different module, just create new folder in *scripts2module* and place ps1 files with functions in it
- **Create new Powershell function Repair-OutlookProfile and distribute it to just chosen clients**
  - in *scripts2module* create new folder *SomeNewModule*. Inside it create file Repair-OutlookProfile.ps1 with identically named function
  - after commit, this will lead to creation of module SomeNewModule (so choose name of folder carefuly), that will contains all functions defined in ps1 scripts in *SomeNewModule* folder
  - edit *modulesConfig.ps1* as follows
  ```powershell
  $modulesConfig = @(
    [PSCustomObject]@{
        folderName   = "SomeNewModule" # name of module
        computerName = "PC-1", "PC-2" # name of computer/s (variable from module Variables could be used too)
    }
  ```
- **Distribute folder "Monitoring_Scripts" (with whatever content, for example Powershell script and helper files (PS modules etc)) to computer "SERVER-10" (to default location ie C:\Windows\Scripts)**
  - place for example folder Monitoring_Scripts to *Custom*
  - edit *customConfig.ps1* as follows
  ```powershell
  $customConfig = @(
    [PSCustomObject]@{
        folderName            = "Monitoring_Scripts"
        computerName          = "SERVER-10"
        customDestinationNTFS = "svc-o365" # if just this account should have read permissions to local folder copy on SERVER-10
    }
  }
  ```
- **Distribute just content of folder "IIS_Config" just to web servers to C:\WWWroot**
  - place for example folder IIS_Config to *Custom*
  - edit *customConfig.ps1* as follows
  ```powershell
  $customConfig = @(
    [PSCustomObject]@{
        folderName            = "IIS_Config"
        computerName          = $webServer # variable is defined in Variables module
        copyJustContent       = 1
        customLocalDestination = "C:\WWWroot"
    }
  }
  ```
- **Distribute folder "Photo_sync" to share "\\DOMAIN\DFS\root\scripts" and limit access to it**
  - place for example folder Photo_sync to *Custom*
  - edit *customConfig.ps1* as follows
  ```powershell
  $customConfig = @(
    [PSCustomObject]@{
        folderName            = "Photo_sync"
        customShareDestination = "\\DOMAIN\DFS\root\scripts"
        customDestinationNTFS   = "APP-1$", "APP-2$", "domain admins"
    }
  }
  ```
- **Auto creation of Scheduled Task/s from XML definition**
  - steps are the same as for any other distribution of content to just custom computers, so:
  - place for example folder AD_monitoring to *Custom*
    - this folder should contains
      - DomainAdmins_check.xml
        - it must be in root of folder and named the same way as the value of key 'scheduledTask' in $customConfig 
        - it must contain exported scheduled task definition (from which will be created sch. task on destination server)
      - some scripts, which will be used by created scheduled task etc
        - on destination computer they will be placed to C:\Windows\Scripts\AD_monitoring, so take it in to consideration when defining the scheduled task!
  - edit *customConfig.ps1* as follows
  ```powershell
  $customConfig = @(
    [PSCustomObject]@{
        folderName            = "AD_monitoring"
        computerName          = "name_of_monitoring_server"
        scheduledTask         = "DomainAdmins_check" 
    }
  }
   ```
   
  this will lead to distribute content of "AD_monitoring" folder to computer "name_of_monitoring_server" and moreover creation of scheduled task named "DomainAdmins_check" from "DomainAdmins_check.xml" definition.
  
  - how to get XML representation of scheduled task?
    - in Task Scheduler console create task, exactly same as should be on destination computer
      - if you want to run some script from 
    - right click on that task and choose 'Export...'
